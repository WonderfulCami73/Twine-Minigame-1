1. I found the tutorials easy to get through. I am comfortable using computers and navigating the internet, so following these steps was not stressful at all. I already knew how to install software and it made the whole process smoother. My comfort level
affected my experience in a good way because I was not stuck on anything and understood what the tutorials were telling me to do.
2. I would say I had a medium effort time with the assignments. Nothhing was too hard, but there were moments where I had to take a break because I was getting overwhelmed. The main resources I used was just the tutorials given. I did not contact the professor or use Discord, but I will use those resources next time if anything bad happens and gets confusing.
